JDBC: Working with ResultSets & Query Batches

Question: Which of these concurrency values represents a ResultSet which can be modified?
[ ] MODIFIABLE_RESULTSET
[ ] CONCUR_RW
[ ] RW_RESULTSET
[x] CONCUR_UPDATABLE

Question: Which TWO of these ResultSet types allow both forward and backward navigation?
[x] TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE
[ ] TYPE_FORWARD_BACKWARD
[ ] TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY
[x] TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE

Question: Assume we do not explicitly set a value for auto-commit for a Connection instance. We have a Statement created from that Connection which we use to perform an insert operation using executeUpdate. Assuming there is nothing wrong with the inserts, what is the outcome?
[ ] The rows are inserted, but not committed
[ ] An error is thrown as executeUpdate is not meant for inserts
[ ] An error is thrown since we need to explicitly set a value for auto-commit
[x] The rows are inserted and committed

Question: Which of these is the method of a Statement instance which is used to run a batch of queries?
[ ] makeBatch().executeUpdate()
[ ] executeQuery()
[x] executeBatch()
[ ] executeUpdate(true)

Question: Out of the following, which is a type of Exception thrown when at least one query in a batch causes an error?
[x] BatchUpdateException
[ ] PreparedException
[ ] MultipleException
[ ] ContraintException

Question: What is the result when we invoke refreshRow() on a ResultSet whose type is CONCUR_READ_ONLY?
[ ] It has no effect and no exception is thrown
[x] An exception is thrown
[ ] The row is deleted from the database
[ ] The refresh takes place and no exception is thrown

Question: Out of the following navigation operations, which one is supported by a TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY ResultSet?
[x] next()
[ ] first()
[ ] last()
[ ] absolute(1)

Question: Which function of a ResultSet can be invoked to retrieve the latest contents of the current row from the database?
[ ] getRow()
[x] refreshRow()
[ ] reload()
[ ] updateRow()

Question: Given a Connection instance named myConn, and a Statement instance myStmt, which of these invocations will create a Savepoint for the transaction?
[ ] myStmt.saveChanges()
[ ] myConn.save("savepoint")
[ ] myStmt.createSavepoint("savepoint")
[x] myConn.setSavepoint("savepoint")

Question: Using a Connection object called myConn, which of these invocations will turn off the auto-commit feature?
[x] myConn.setAutoCommit(false)
[ ] myConn.disableAutoCommit()
[ ] myConn.turnOff("auto-commit")
[ ] myConn.set("auto-commit", false)

Question: Out of the following operations on a ResultSet, which TWO perform navigations based on the current cursor position?
[ ] first()
[x] relative()
[ ] absolute()
[x] previous()

Question: Given a Connection instance named myConn, and a Statement instance myStmt, which of these invocations will undo all uncommitted changes on a Connection?
[ ] myStmt.undo()
[x] myConn.rollback()
[ ] myStmt.rollback()
[ ] myConn.undo()


Question: Which function can we invoke using a ResultSet to move the cursor to a point where a new row can be added to it?
[ ] setInsert()
[ ] rowInsert()
[ ] addRow()
[x] moveToInsertRow()
