Java Persistence API: Getting Started With JPA & Hibernate
==========================================================

Question: Which of the following is NOT a reason to use an Object Relational Mapping framework when working with relational databases using a high-level programming language such as Java?
[ ] The fundamental unit of programming for relational databases and Java is different
[ ] Relational tables express relationships using constraints and programming languages use design patterns
[ ] Relational tables consist of rows and columns and objects consist of fields
[x] There is no way to query data from a database without using a language such as Java

Question: What is Hibernate?
[x] An ORM framework implementation that helps map objects and relationships to database tables
[ ] A framework that allows you to run queries on relational database tables
[ ] An interface that allows you to express object relational mapping using annotations
[ ] A validation framework that ensures that the data you store in tables is consistent

Question:  What is the Java persistence API or JPA?
[ ] A validation framework that ensures that the data you store in tables is consistent
[ ] A framework that allows you to run queries on relational database tables
[ ] An ORM framework implementation that helps map objects and relationships to database tables
[x] An interface that allows you to express object relational mapping using annotations

Question: What is MySQL workbench?
[ ] A constraint validator for a MySQL database
[x] A user interface which connects to an underlying database
[ ] A database server that can be used to store data
[ ] An IDE for Java which you can use to build Java projects

Question: What is Apache Maven?
[x] A build management system to manage dependencies in Java
[ ] An IDE to work with Java projects
[ ] A relational database management system
[ ] A graphical user interface which can be used to query a database

Question: What is MySQL used for?
[ ] A document database system using to hold data in the form of JSON documents
[ ] A graphical user interface to query data stored in a relational database
[ ] A columnar database system used to hold data in the form of key-value pairs
[x] A relational database management system to hold data in the form of rows and columns

Question: What is the role of Apache Maven in Java projects?
[ ] Framework to connect to a relational database
[x] Framework to manage the dependencies for your Java code
[ ] Framework to manage syntax highlighting and unit tests for your code
[ ] Framework to host Java applications on a server

Question: What is the file that Maven uses to specify Java libraries that your project depends on?
[ ] servlet.xml
[ ] dependency.xml
[ ] web.xml
[x] pom.xml

Question: Which of the following statements are true about entities?
[ ] They represent constraints on values in a database table
[ ] They map to relationships between tables in a database
[x] Entity objects correspond to records in a database table
[x] They map to a table in the underlying database

Question: What is the role of the persistence.xml file in JPA?
[x] Specifies how the ORM framework can connect to the underlying database
[ ] Specifies how many entities and relationships you are modelling
[ ] Specifies all the JPA related annotations that you use in your project
[ ] Specifies the libraries that JPA depends on

Question: What input does the EntityManagerFactory need to connect to the underlying database?
[ ] The username and password used to connect to the database
[ ] The application token generated by the database, which can be used to connect to the database
[ ] The name of the persistence unit, which contains connection details, from the persistence.xml file
[ ] The name of the database, along with its username and password

Question: Match the values for the database action property in persistence.xml with the behavior of the actions.
	Tables will be created, existing tables will not be deleted
		B:“create”
	Tables, if they exist, will be deleted and new ones will be set up each time you run your application
		C:“drop_and_create”
	Tables will not be created; they need to already exist for your application to work
		A:“none”

Question: Which of the following is true about persistence configurations while working in JPA?
[x] Tables can be created using scripts
[x] Tables can be created using the Entity objects
[ ] Tables cannot be created using JPA
[ ] Tables can be created using JSON specifications in code
